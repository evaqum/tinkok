This is a WIP reimagined mobile app for Tinkoff Bank.

Source code for this wasn't meant to go public this soon but my portfolio is pretty much empty and I'm looking for job so here we are.

The main focus of the app is clean UI with some funny animations so everything else might be lacking (code included).

Props to [@evaqum](https://github.com/evaqum) for designing this, truly the only person I can <span style="font-size:0.5em">sometimes</span> trust
